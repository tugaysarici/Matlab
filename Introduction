Introduce: Basic numerical methods and their applications in engineering.

Learning outcomes: Solve nonlinear equations with a single unknown using numerical methods; systems of linear equations using numerical
methods; Apply basic principles of optimization using numerical methods; ....

Matlab'ı diğer dillerden ayıran en önemli özelliği "command windows". Diğer dillerde ve Matlab'da tüm kodu yazıp sonrasında derleyip ça-
lıştırma mevcut. Fakat command windows ile yazarken derleyip çalıştırmaya izin veriliyor.

Numerical methods are techniques by which mathematical problems are formulated so that they can be solved with arithmetic operations.

Non-Computer Methods: Analytical (Exact) Methods, Graphical Solutions, Calculators.
(tedious: bıktırıcı)

Why study numerical methods?
- Numerical methods are extremely powerful problem solving tools.
- Numerical methods are an efficient vehicle for learning to program.
- Numerical methods provide a vehicle to reinforce your understanding of mathematics by reducing higher mathematics to basic arithmetic
equations.
(reinforce: pekiştirmek, sağlamlaştırmak)

Computers are great tools, however, without fundamental understanding of engineering problems, they will be useless.

Benefits of Simulations
- Cost savings by minimizing material usage.
- Increased speed to market through reduced product development time.
- Optimized structural performance with thorough analysis
- Eliminate expensive trial-and-error.
