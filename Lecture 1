INTRODUCTION TO MATLAB

Matlab responds to commands by printing text in the command window, or by opening a figure window for graphical output.

>>demo    opens the help window.

% for single comment line
%{ for multiple comment lines %}
... special comment line ...

>> 8/2            returns 4 and ans equals to 4.
>> ans*5          returns 20 and ans equals to 20.

>> a = 5          the 5 is assinged to a.
>> b = 6          the 6 is assinged to a.
>> c = b/a        the b/a is assinged to a.

>> pi             ans equals to 3.1416.

>> sin(ans/3)     returns 0.9954 and ans equals to 0.9954.

% Dereceler modu yok, açılar radyan ile ölçülür. (There is no “degrees” mode. All angles are measured in radians.)

>> log(256)       returns 5.5452, because this represents ln256 and the base is e.

>> log10(256)     returns 2.4082 and 10 represents the logarithmic base.

>> log2(256)      returns 8, the logarithmic base is 2.

>> help sqrt      shows the usage of the sqrt function.

>> doc plot       shows the documentation of the plot function.

>> lookfor funtionName      searchs this function name. If you are not sure what function name is, you can use it.

% When lookfor is used, >> is not appeared on the screen. You should press ctrl + c.

% In the command windows if the semicolon (;) is not used, the operation that is made is not shown to user. Like:

>> x = 5;
>> y = sqrt(59);
>> z = log(y) + x^0.25
z = 3.5341

% Multiple statements can be made by ; and ,. Like:

>> a = 5; b = sin(a), c = cosh(a)
b = -0.9589
c = 74.2099

In Matlab, variable names:
• Begin with one of a–z or A–Z
• Have remaining characters chosen from a–z, A–Z, 0–9
• Maximum 31 characters
• Should not be the name of a built-in variable, built-in function, or user-defined function. 
(built in: içinde var olan)

% mySum and mysum are different variables. Matlab is case sensitive.

% ans is used when that expression is not assigned to a variable.
% eps is floating point precision (i dont understand).
% realmax/realmin represents largest/smallest positive floating point number.
% Inf represent infinitive
% NaN represents 0/0.

% √−1 is represented i or j in Matlab.
